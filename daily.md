Chinese characters are like emojis. Each character has a meaning. These are written in Hanji.
* A single horizontal line is pronounced 'yi' (yee). 一 
* A double horizontal line is pronounced 'er' 二
* A triple horizontal line is pronounced 'san'  三 (sun)
* yi, er, san means 1, 2, 3. Yi LLM probably meant 1 LLM.
* shui (water) is written in hanzi like a combination of 7 and k. 水. It's written from the stem of k first (like a J), then 7 and then the < part.
* ka fei in hanji is written as 咖啡. The app practiced me for 10 times for ka part first and then fei part next. Ka part is like box followed by a pseudo pi symbol followed by the same box. Then, fei is like box followed by mirrored E and then E. Weird to describe all of this.

* Practiced the same words but in combination of: re, cha, zhou, tang, mi fan, ka fei, he, zhe, shi. Completed all exercises for the day very quickly and even spoke the words into the mic.
* Practiced Hanji for mi fan (米饭) and re. I found fan (饭) and re (热) extremely difficult to practice. Mi was easy though.
