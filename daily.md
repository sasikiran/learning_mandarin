Chinese characters are like emojis. Each character has a meaning. These are written in Hanji.
* A single horizontal line is pronounced 'yi' (yee). 一 
* A double horizontal line is pronounced 'er' 二
* A triple horizontal line is pronounced 'san'  三 (sun)
* yi, er, san means 1, 2, 3. Yi LLM probably meant 1 LLM.
* shui (water) is written in hanzi like a combination of 7 and k. 水. It's written from the stem of k first (like a J), then 7 and then the < part.
* ka fei in hanji is written as 咖啡. The app practiced me for 10 times for ka part first and then fei part next. Ka part is like box followed by a pseudo pi symbol followed by the same box. Then, fei is like box followed by mirrored E and then E. Weird to describe all of this.

* Practiced the same words but in combination of: re, cha, zhou, tang, mi fan, ka fei, he, zhe, shi. Completed all exercises for the day very quickly and even spoke the words into the mic.
* Practiced Hanji for mi fan (米饭) and re. I found fan (饭) and re (热) extremely difficult to practice. Mi was easy though.

19 Aug, 2025
-------------------
* Practiced Hanji characters for mi fan and re. I think I am a bit more confident in writing these today.
* Greetings: 
	* Nǐ hǎo (pronounced nee hau) meaning hello or literally translates to you good?
	* Nǐn hǎo is also hello but is said to someone elderly or superior. I am assuming this is like saying _namasthe ji_ to an elderly. Another common way to greet is to ask: Nǐ hǎo ma? (which translates to how are you?)
	* You can respond to Ni hao with:
		* hěn hǎo - very good
		- bù hǎo - not good
		- hái hǎo - so so (or okay or not bad).
	* Tiānqì means weather. It's pronounced: Tyen-chee. So, Tiānqì hái hǎo ma? means: Is the weather okay? You can reply with: hái hǎo (it's okay or it's alright which is a modest form of response).

* Practiced Hanzi for mǐ fàn (米饭), hé (和), chá (茶), tāng (汤)
* Found all of them to be somewhat simple except fàn 饭.
* There are places where I want to write the characters in certain way. For example, chá (茶) is similar to drawing a hut with a chimney on top but the order of Hanji strokes are forcing me to do it in a different way in software. If I write it on a paper, I would definitely draw it like a hut. Similarly, the mǐ (米) part is like an asterisk or a flower but the order of strokes shown in the software is different. This needs practice. Maybe its different for a good reason? Time will tell.

21 Aug, 2025
-------------------
* Practiced Hanzi for "zhe" (这) from "zhe shi". The character on the computer looks a bit different, the left bottom part was certainly like a hand-written 3.
* Practiced Hanzi for zhōu (粥). 
* Both the characters practiced today were easier.

-------------------
* Practiced Hanzi for "Zhè shì" (这是).
* Practiced Hanzi for Dòufu (豆腐).
