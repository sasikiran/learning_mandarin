Chinese characters are like emojis. Each character has a meaning. These are written in Hanji.
* A single horizontal line is pronounced 'yi' (yee). 一 
* A double horizontal line is pronounced 'er' 二
* A triple horizontal line is pronounced 'san'  三 (sun)
* yi, er, san means 1, 2, 3. Yi LLM probably meant 1 LLM.
* shui (water) is written in hanzi like a combination of 7 and k. 水. It's written from the stem of k first (like a J), then 7 and then the < part.
* ka fei in hanji is written as 咖啡. The app practiced me for 10 times for ka part first and then fei part next. Ka part is like box followed by a pseudo pi symbol followed by the same box. Then, fei is like box followed by mirrored E and then E. Weird to describe all of this.

18 Aug, 2025
-------------------
* Practiced the same words but in combination of: re, cha, zhou, tang, mi fan, ka fei, he, zhe, shi. Completed all exercises for the day very quickly and even spoke the words into the mic.
* Practiced Hanji for mi fan (米饭) and re. I found fan (饭) and re (热) extremely difficult to practice. Mi was easy though.

19 Aug, 2025
-------------------
* Practiced Hanji characters for mi fan and re. I think I am a bit more confident in writing these today.
* Greetings: 
	* Nǐ hǎo (pronounced nee hau) meaning hello or literally translates to you good?
	* Nǐn hǎo is also hello but is said to someone elderly or superior. I am assuming this is like saying _namasthe ji_ to an elderly. Another common way to greet is to ask: Nǐ hǎo ma? (which translates to how are you?)
	* You can respond to Ni hao with:
		* hěn hǎo - very good
		- bù hǎo - not good
		- hái hǎo - so so (or okay or not bad).
	* Tiānqì means weather. It's pronounced: Tyen-chee. So, Tiānqì hái hǎo ma? means: Is the weather okay? You can reply with: hái hǎo (it's okay or it's alright which is a modest form of response).

-------------------
* Practiced Hanzi for mǐ fàn (米饭), hé (和), chá (茶), tāng (汤)
* Found all of them to be somewhat simple except fàn 饭.
* There are places where I want to write the characters in certain way. For example, chá (茶) is similar to drawing a hut with a chimney on top but the order of Hanji strokes are forcing me to do it in a different way in software. If I write it on a paper, I would definitely draw it like a hut. Similarly, the mǐ (米) part is like an asterisk or a flower but the order of strokes shown in the software is different. This needs practice. Maybe its different for a good reason? Time will tell.

21 Aug, 2025
-------------------
* Practiced Hanzi for "zhe" (这) from "zhe shi". The character on the computer looks a bit different, the left bottom part was certainly like a hand-written 3.
* Practiced Hanzi for zhōu (粥). 
* Both the characters practiced today were easier.

22 Aug, 2025
-------------------
* Practiced Hanzi for "Zhè shì" (这是).
* Practiced Hanzi for Dòufu (豆腐).

23 Aug, 2025
-------------------
* Practiced speaking phrases in a combination of mǐ fàn (米饭), hé (和), chá (茶), tāng (汤), kā fēi (咖啡), rè (热), zhōu (粥), zhè shì (这是)
* Practiced identifying phrases with translations - English to Mandarin and vice versa in speech and written form.

24 Aug, 2025
-------------------
* Practiced a combination of speaking phrases for all the words so far: mǐ fàn (米饭), hé (和), chá (茶), tāng (汤), kā fēi (咖啡), rè (热), zhōu (粥), zhè shì (这是)
* Started practicing nationalities:
	* America is Měiguó 美国
	* Japan is Rìběn 日本
	* China is Zhōngguó 中国
So, Zhè shì rìběn 这是日本 means This is Japan.

25 Aug, 2025
-------------------
* If Měiguó is American, Měiguó rén is American. Similarly, if Rìběn is Japan, Rìběn rén is Japanese and Zhōngguó rén 中国人 is Chinese.
* Practiced phrases such as: Wǒ shì měiguó rén 我是美国人 (I am American), Wǒ shì rìběn rén 我是日本人 (I am Japanese) and Wǒ shì Zhōngguó rén along with some revision on previous food items.

26 Aug, 2025
-------------------
* Hánguó 韩国 means Korea. Hánguó rén 韩国人 means Korean.
* Nǐ ne usually refers to 'and you?' or 'and how about you?'. For example: Wǒ shì zhōngguó rén, nǐ ne? 我是中国人，你呢？

27 Aug, 2025
-------------------
* Practiced the same nationality phrases.
* Practiced Hanji for měiguó rén, rìběn rén and zhōngguó rén. One common and easy aspect is that all three words have repeating rén 人 and two words have guó 国 also in common. Zhōngguó rén 中国人 is very easy to write in Hanji.
